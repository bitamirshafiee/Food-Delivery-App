It will show a list of restaurants and a tag list on top which you can filter restaurants according
to the selected tags.
By clicking on each restaurant you will see the details of the restaurant and if it is opened or
closed.

First we get the list of restaurants and show them to the user, then we request for the list of tags
that each
restaurant has in the background, and update the restaurants accordingly. I didn't want the user to
wait so long to see the restaurants list, so I request for the tags after getting the restaurants
list and update the UI.

## How to install the app

Just clone the repository, build the project and then you can easily run it on a device or emulator.
